## How to contribute?

All contrubutions are welcome. First check the open issues and see if you can help with any of them. If you want to add a new feature, please create an issue first so that others can have a look at it. Below are the steps you should follow so that your PR can be merged easily.
1. Check out the [issues](https://github.com/Oxlac/Scribblr/issues) page.
2. If you want to contribute a new feature or solve a issue, it is recommended you make it an issue for others to have a brief look at what's happening if the proposed feature is not already in the open issues.
3. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
4. Make the changes you want to make.
5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub.
6. Create a pull request to the `master` branch of the `oxlac/promptpedia` repository.
7. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Jrd6A94g).
